# My Rust competitive programming setup

## Requirements

most of these can be replaced by similar things but I based my personal setup on these

- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for making building and testing easier
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) for writing shell functions and abbreviations / aliases 
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as my terminal emulator
